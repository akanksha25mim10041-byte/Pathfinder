# Project Statement: Career Interest Survey

# Problem Statement

Many students and individuals struggle to identify career paths that align with their personal interests and preferences. The current project addresses this by providing a simple, quick, and objective-based survey to gauge an individual's affinity towards five key career domains: STEM, Arts, Social, Business, and Tech. The core problem is the lack of an accessible, structured tool for initial career interest assessment, which this system aims to solve by quantifying interests and suggesting corresponding career paths.

# Scope of the Project

The scope of this project is limited to:

1.User Input: Collecting the user's name, class/grade, and their responses (1-5 rating) to five specific interest questions, one for each domain.
2.coring Logic: Calculating a numerical score for each of the five career domains (STEM, ARTS, SOCIAL, BUSINESS, TECH) by summing the user's rating for the corresponding question.
3.Recommendation: Identifying the domain with the highest total score as the user's "strongest career domain."
4.Output: Displaying a report that includes the user's name, their scores for all domains, the strongest domain, and a predefined list of suggested careers for that top domain.

The project does NOT include: machine learning, complex psychological profiling, user data storage, web interface development, or detailed job market analysis.

1.Students (Middle School/High School): Individuals in the early stages of education who are beginning to think about their subject choices and future careers.
